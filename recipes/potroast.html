    <h3>Perfect Pot Roast</h3>
    <p>This all in one pot roast recipe will feed 6, needs 15 minutes of prep work, and is done in roughly 3 to 4 hours depending on the weight of the roast.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>One 3-to-5 pound chuck roast</li>
        <li>2 or 3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 whole onions, peeled and halved</li>
        <li>6 to 8 whole carrots, unpeeled, cut into 2-inch peice</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine. optional</li>
        <li>3 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 or 3 springs fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 or 3 springs fresh thyme</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 275 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Generously salt and pepper the chuck roast.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in large pot over medium-high heat. Add the halved onions to the pot, browning them on both sides. Remove the onions to a plate.</li>
        <li>Throw the carrots into the same very hot pot and toss them around a bit until slightly browned, about a minute or so. Reserve the carrots with the onions.</li>
        <li>Add more olive oil if needed and place the roast in the pot. Sear for about a minute on all sides until it is brown all over. Remove the roast to a plate. </li>
        <li>With the burner still on high, use either red wine or beef broth to deglaze the pot, scraping the bottom with a whisk. Place the roast back into the pot and add enough beef stock to cover the meat halfway.</li>
        <li>Add in the onions and the carrots, along with the fresh herbs.</li>
        <li>Put the lid on, then roast for 3 hours for a 3-pound roast. For a 4 to 5-pound roast, plan on 4 hours. The roast is ready when it is fall-apart tender.</li>
