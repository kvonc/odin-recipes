    <h3>One-Pot Spaghetti With Cherry Tomotaoes</h3>
    <p>In this simple recipe, raw pasta and cherry tomatoes are simmered together in a single pan, cooking the pasta and forming a thick, starchy sauce at the same time.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound of spaghetti</li>
        <li>1 pound of cherry tomatoes, halved (about 2 pints)</li>
        <li>2 lemons, zested</li>
        <li>1/4 cup + 3 tablespoons of olive oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons of kosher salt (more to taste if necessary</li>
        <li>Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese for each serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring just over a quart of water to a boil.</li>
        <li>Place spaghetti, tomatoes, lemon zest, oil, and 2 teaspoons of kosher salt in a large, dry, shallow pan. (The pan should fit the dry spaghetti.)</li>
        <li>Carefully add the boiling water to the pan with the spaghetti. Cover pan, and bring up to a boil.</li>
        <li>Remove lid and simmer for about 6 minutes, using tongs to move the spaghetti around now and then so it doesn't stick.</li>
        <li>Add kale or spinach and continue cooking until remaining liquid has reduced to a sauce and the pasta is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Taste, season with salt and pepper, and top with Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
